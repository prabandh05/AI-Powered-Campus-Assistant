DSCE has been accredited by National Assessment & Accreditation Council [NAAC] with CGPA of 3.42 on four point scale at ‘A’ grade valid upto July 10, 2021. The NAAC Peer team in its final report had desired that DSCE should have an Internal Quality Assurance Cell (IQAC) for quality assurance and continuous improvement. The NAAC has also proposed that every accredited institution should establish an IQAC as a post accreditation quality sustenance measure. During October 2013, the NAAC have notified a revised guideline of IQAC and submission of Annual Quality Assurance Report (AQAR). As per the guidelines, the institutions need to submit yearly the Annual Quality Assurance Report (AQAR) to NAAC. A functional Internal Quality Assurance Cell (IQAC) and timely submission of Annual Quality Assurance Reports (AQARs) are the Minimum Institutional Requirements (MIR) to volunteer for second, third or subsequent cycle’s accreditation.
To develop a system for conscious, consistent and catalytic action to improve the academic and administrative performance of the institution.
To promote measures for institutional functioning towards quality enhancement through internalization of quality culture and institutionalization of best practices.

The most impactful experience in a person's life is undoubtedly college. From paving a path to embark on our professional careers to solidifying the goals we would strive to achieve in the long term, studying CSE at DSCE has played a huge part in helping me to get where I am today. With the guidance of many outstanding professors, opportunities to work on projects at companies like Nokia and various scintillating workshops provided, I was equipped with the confidence and the skills required to secure a job offer from Intel.  Because of the myriad of subjects offered and taught in the CSE branch of DSCE, I could identify the areas I was most intrigued by and proceeded to apply and get into the Master's in Computer Science programme at the University of Texas, Austin, which I am pursuing currently.  All in all, aside from providing me with a wonderful college experience, DSCE has most definitely instilled in me the skills required to excel in my professional career, which I am truly grateful for.

The only thing that matter is passion towards whatever it is you're doing. Trying to learn something because you are interested in it and not for marks makes all the difference. As far as I am concerned, I hardly attended classes, sat in the last bench and had a mediocre GPA...but what mattered was my love for what I did.

Name: Charu Srivastava     Company: Class method
Branch:
B.E., (ECE)
Salary:
22.7 LPA
Didn’t imagine I would be writing a “success story” someday. Cut short, after a lot of hurdles and support from family and friends, I have been campus placed and going to commence my corporate career soon in Tokyo (Japan) along with few other DSCEians. But I have learned the hard way. Before this, I was unable to convert successful written tests to respective placement offers that affected my confidence to be honest. But I never disheartened, rather I kept rectifying my mistakes from each failure and due to encouragement from my close ones. I tried a bit harder every next time, which eventually led my selection to Class method as an AWS engineer.
Name: DEEKSHITA SAVANUR     Company: Class method
Branch:
B.E., (CSE)
Salary:

DSCE has helped me land a job in Japan, I have always loved to travel and experience new cultures, which is why I was very excited when Zenken came on campus with multiple roles and companies. I went through many rounds in different companies but couldn’t get through a few. Although, I never gave up and kept applying. Finally, I got placed into Classmethod Inc. as an AWS engineer. I am excited to start my work in Tokyo next year and I’m having fun learning Japanese. This job would not only teach me new skills and ensure career growth, it will help me learn about a new culture and fulfill my travel quest.

Concentrating on Data Structures and Algorithms helped in coding as well as technical rounds. Cracking the coding interview book is very important and helped during the interview.

I always wanted to get a job at a prestigious company like AppDynamics, for which my college Dayananda Sagar College of Engineering paved me an easy path. I wanted to be a successful engineer which is proved through my performance and achievements. AppDynamics is a place where I can also learn. I would like to take this as an opportunity to thank my college. I hope my success story goes on like this…

Salary:
6.75 LPA
I come from a city named Davanagere. From my childhood days, I was interested in Mathematics and Science so aspired of taking up Engineering. After completion of 2 years in Information Science and Technology, I was interested in current trends and technologies. Few months of internship and workshops on IoT, Android and Machine Learning was a huge start for me. As of today I am a learner and need to achieve a lot more.

Branch:
B.E., (CSE)
Salary:

The interview was on 7th August 2019, it had 1 apti and coding test, 2 tech rounds and 1 HR, all on same day. I was happy for getting shortlisted towards further rounds. Interviewers were warm and friendly, which made us more comfortable to answer their questions confidently. By the end of day after all rounds, we got our results. Feels great to be placed in Perfios, and excited to work for same.
Name: MEHUL PODDAR     Company: Cisco Systems Pvt. Ltd
Branch:
B.E., (CSE)
Salary:
29 LPA
With the right kind of passion, you sit before a machine and the code writes itself. Programming for me – is not work, it's a hobby; right from translating silly childhood games with code to freelancing. Never content – constantly found the need to prove myself to myself. Landing an opportunity to interview with Cisco, I found myself competing against 90+ candidates from in and outside Bangalore having contrasting experiences in the field – candidates from the NITs, graduates from 2009 and so on.
Name: K R Vadiraj     Company: Amazon
Branch:
B.E., (CSE)
Salary:
19 LPA
Growing up in a family where expectations and standards are to be met, my journey towards success began. The oppressive feeling of guilt made me realize my self-worth. It was the constant zeal and motivation for my passion with sheer dedication and commitment that paved way to where I’m today. Leaving the world of denial to being more optimistic, I landed in my dream job. I’m thrilled to be a part of this ever-giving community. This journey is just the start of a new success story altogether.
Name: VenkatAnirudh S N     Company: Magnitude India Pvt Ltd
Branch:
B.E., (CSE)
Salary:
10 LPA
Magnitude was the 5th interview that I attended. Initially I found it very difficult to clear the technical rounds and in a few cases I was very close but ended up being rejected. This actually reduced my confidence level, nevertheless I never gave up. I realized that one should never give up; he/she will definitely get what he/she deserves. The only thing one must do is keep trying, learn from your mistakes and try to rectify it. In the end, I was extremely delighted on getting placed in magnitude.
Name: RACHAPALLI MUNINAIMISHA     Company: COGNIZANT SALESFORCE
Branch:
B.E., (CSE)
Salary:
5.2 LPA
I believe in “WHEN WE EXPECT MORE, WE ACHIEVE MORE”. To achieve something big hard work is the major factor, so put a goal and work hard for it. I’m really thankful for our college management for providing plenty of opportunities and great platform to showcase our talents.
Name: Navya Dua     Company: Breathbit
Branch:
B.E., (CSE)
Salary:
21 LPA
Placements are terrifying especially when you have given a try for more than two companies but could not even make it to the 1st round. I'm a student of CSE department. I got placed at ‘Breathbit’ as a Software developer. It was one of the best moments of my life. Here, learning wasn’t just learning. It was more than kicking off my preparation with aptitude test which was the first round and acing it among 150-200 students was the first step on the ladder. For the interview process in Breathbit, 12 among us were selected. For this I started with bracing up my resume and also brushed up my technical skills. I was put up with technical and situation based questions during the interview. When the results were declared, my happiness knew no bounds as I was one of those 2 selected.

Counselling Center
At DSCE,
Counselling Center
is dedicated to supporting students with challenges related to emotional and mental well-being, academic stress, and other personal concerns. The sessions are conducted on a
one-to-one basis
, allowing students to openly share their difficulties in a safe, confidential, and supportive environment.
Each counselling session typically lasts
45–60 minutes
, with the frequency and follow-up depending on the student’s individual needs, goals, and progress. While some concerns can be addressed through short-term counselling, more complex issues may require periodic follow-up sessions to ensure gradual and sustained improvement. Students seeking help are scheduled for the earliest available appointment.
Counselling services are provided by
qualified counsellors, licensed psychologists, and therapists
, who approach every student with empathy, respect, and non-judgment, ensuring complete confidentiality.
The counsellor’s role is to:
Help students cope with crisis situations and reduce distress.
Support personal growth and overall well-being.
Assist in reshaping thought patterns, emotional responses, and behaviours.
Set clear, achievable goals to track and encourage progress.
Outcome of Counselling
Through counselling, students are able to:
Develop effective coping skills.
Improve decision-making abilities.
Strengthen interpersonal relationships.
Experience positive changes, often within just a few sessions, with sustained improvement through follow-ups where needed.

“MUDITA”, a term originating from Sanskrit embodies the profound joy derived from witnessing the happiness and well-being of others. Team Mudita, the OFFICIAL SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY CELL of Dayananda Sagar College of Engineering, is committed to helping those in need. The team's fundamental goal is to cultivate a society where smiles abound, spreading joy across the populace. Team Mudita also focuses on highlighting the significance and awareness of core values and basic ethics in life. Among the forum's key objectives are empowering and engaging with the less fortunate and underprivileged, and fostering meaningful and enduring connections within the community.</br > Team Mudita's modest steps towards societal betterment aim to spark significant change and bring hope to many disheartened lives. Be it offering recreational breaks for senior citizens, organizing fests for college housekeeping staff, conducting career guidance programs and interactive learning sessions for underprivileged children, or collecting and distributing essential commodities to those in dire need, Team Mudita is dedicated to making a difference. With unwavering commitment, Team Mudita strives to uplift and transform lives. Together, we grow.
Vision
To socialize and spread happiness among people who are in dire need.
To create a pleasant atmosphere and spread optimistic vibes.
To help and support those in need.
To uplift the underprivileged classes of society.
Collaborations of Team Mudita
Team Mudita has teamed up with various organizations to boost community well-being. Through our partnership with Sahas NGO at the Lalbagh Flower Show, Team Mudita made sure the event space was kept clean. With Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP), Team Mudita managed the Kadlekayi Parishe event in Basavannagudi, checking vendor setups and keeping the area clean. Team Mudita collaborated with Oracle to distribute beds collected from college to slums in Anjanapura. Once again, Team Mudita collaborated with Oracle to organize a poster design event at Nirmala Vidyalaya for Global Handwash Day to promote cleanliness and hygiene. Team Mudita also conducted a football event for underprivileged government school students at Saint Joseph High School grounds.

Media Outreach
On the month of June 2022, Mudita got featured on "This Week India News", a news platform which showcased our event "Valuable Vintage" where we visit old age homes.
Amhiti
"Amhiti: Where Hope Found a Helping Hand"
This event was designed to bring the Dayananda Sagar College of Engineering together every year for three days to collect essential items and donations which include bedsheets, toiletries, packed food, stationery, clothes, school supplies, toys, pet food, sports equipment, and more, to extend a helping hand to those facing challenging circumstances and offer them a glimmer of hope for a brighter future. Amhiti as an event was a living example of this: Happiness doesn't result from what we get, but from what we give. An event like this reinstates our belief that when we come together as a community, we can create positive change. Even the smallest of contributions will make a difference in the lives of those in need and bring joy to their lives. The love that poured in during Amhiti has strengthened our resolve to serve the community.

M/S Oriflame also sponsored the visitors to their stall with a free facial and makeup orientation session.

“I know it all”.
This included playing of tagline quizzes, logo quizzes, and guessing of audio clips along with musical chair.  The second day involved the following games:
“One minute game”

These were games that involved various activities such as rapid fires which awaited quick responses from the participants.
“Cooking without fire”
was held on the third day wherein the participants prepared a variety of mouth-watering dishes and this event was judged by our respected Vice-Principal and Director.
The oriflame gift hampers were then given away as prizes to the respective winners of all the events but the highlight of the event was
“the lucky draw winners”
by Oriflame. Overall the three-day women’s day celebration was a very highly spirited one and the participants as well as the organisers had a wonderful time.
